Assignment: Movie Review Service
The assignment is to implement a service related to movie reviews, and
following is the description of it. You can choose any language that you
are comfortable with. Please push your code to Github and share the link
with us when you reply.
Overview
The movie review service collects reviews for movies from its users. Later
these movie reviews are used to derive insights which helps in enriching
the lives of its customers with entertainment.


Internal Capabilities
1. Users of the service can review only movies which are released so
far, they cannot review upcoming movies.
2. Users can give a review-score between 1 to 10. (Higher the score the
better the liking for the movie). Currently we are not allowing a
user to review the same movie multiple times.
3. The service by default on-boards a user as a ‘viewer’. Later a
‘viewer’ can be upgraded to a ‘critic’ after he/she has published
more than 3 reviews for various movies.
4. Critics are considered as experts in the judgement here, so critics
reviews will be captured with more weightage. i.e. 6 review rating of
a critic will be considered as 12 (2x) NOTE: Older reviews by the
user as `viewer` shall not be affected.
5. Good To Have: Based on the users behaviour, the service should give
the capability to plugin more user upgradation policies. Eg. User ->
Critic -> Expert -> Admin.



Requirements
Each of the following features needs to be implemented:
1. Adding users and movies.
2. User to review a movie.
3. List top n movies by total review score by ‘viewer’ in a particular
year of release.
4. List top n movies by total review score by ‘viewer’ in a particular
genre.
5. List top n movies by total review score by ‘critics’ in a particular
year of release.
6. List top n movies by total review score by ‘critics’ in a particular
genre.
7. Average review score in a particular year of release.
8. Average review score in a particular genre.
9. Average review score for a particular movie.


Expectations
1. Make sure that you have working and demonstrable code for all the
above requirements.
2. Feature requirements should be strictly followed. Work on the
expected output first and then add good-to-have features of your own.
3. Use of proper abstraction, separation of concerns is required.
4. Code should easily accommodate new requirements with minimal changes.
5. Proper exception handling is required.
6. Code should be modular, readable and unit-testable.
Important Notes:
● Do not use any database store, use in-memory data structure.
● Do not write an API on top of the service methods.
● Do not create any UI for the application.
● Do not build a Command line interface, executing test cases or via
the simple Main function should be sufficient.



Sample Test Cases:

1. Onboard 10 movies onto your platform in 3 different years.

    a. Add Movie("Don" released in Year 2006 for Genres “Action” & “Comedy”)
    
    b. Add Movie("Tiger" released in Year 2008 for Genre “Drama”)
    
    c. Add Movie("Padmaavat" released in Year 2006 for Genre “Comedy”)
    
    d. Add Movie("Lunchbox" released in Year 2021 for Genre “Drama”)
    
    e. Add Movie("Guru" released in Year 2006 for Genre “Drama”)
    
    f. Add Movie("Metro" released in Year 2006 for Genre “Romance”)


2. Add users to the system:

    a. Add User(“SRK”)
    
    b. Add User(“Salman”)
    
    c. Add User(“Deepika”)
   
   
3. Add Reviews:

    a. add_review(“SRK”, “Don”, 2)
    
    b. add_review(“SRK”, “Padmavaat”, 8)
    
    c. add_review(“Salaman”, “Don”, 5)
    
    d. add_review(“Deepika”, “Don”, 9)
    
    e. add_review(“Deepika”, “Guru”, 6)
    
    f. add_review(“SRK”,”Don”, 10) - Exception multiple reviews not allowed
    
    g. add_review(“Deepika”, “Lunchbox”, 5) - Exception movie yet to be released
    
    h. add_review(“SRK”, “Tiger”, 5). Since ‘SRK’ has published 3 reviews, he is promoted to ‘critic’ now.
    
    i. add_review(“SRK”, “Metro”, 7)


4. List top 1 movie by review score in “2006” year:

   a. Top in Year “2006”: Output: Don - 16 ratings (sum of all ratings of Deepika, Salman & SRK)

   b. Top in Year “2006” by “critics_preferred”: Output: Metro - 14 ratings (only SRK gave 7 for Metro as critic)


5. List top 1 movie by review score in “Drama” genre:
Output: Guru - 6 ratings

6. List top movie by average review score in “2006” year: Output: (2 + 8 + 5 + 9 + 6 + 14) / 6 = 7.33 ratings (7 of “Metro” considered twice since it was submitted by critic)
